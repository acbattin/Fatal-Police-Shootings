**Figure 1.** Stacked Bar Chart. The goal of this plot is to visualize the disparity among the racial groups in addition to explore the distribution of gender within each racial group.

The number of people killed by firearms by the police January 1, 2015, to December 1, 2023, were grouped into five different races. The entries that were missing data for the race variable were not plotted, and since there is only one singular entry for “Black and Hispanic” was grouped into the “Other” variable for the purpose of this plot. We see that the data collected is predominately of white victims, and overall, the distribution of race seems similar to that of the United States on average (U.S. Census, 2023). Figure 1 also provides us with the added information, males are far more often the victims of a fatal police shooting than women are across all racial groups.

**Figure 2.** Age Distribution across Racial Groups. Goal is to compare the age distributions across racial groups and if anything can be determined or suggested.
